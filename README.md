# Codenames Game

Codenames is a multiplayer word association game where two teams compete to find all their agents' codenames first. This implementation uses Qt for the user interface and WebSockets for real-time interaction between players.

# Multiplayer vs Local Play

Our game allows you to run on a single device or 4 devices depending.

In multiplayer, Qt Websockets is required to play.

To allow our game to run on gaul we have a version without multiplayer at

## Requirements


#### Network Requirements for Online Play

The network you are using must allow websocket traffic. In our testing, school wifis don't have it configured, 
but something like a cellular hotspot or home wifi allows for it.

Another solution is to utilize tunnels services (e.g. ngrok) to allow external devices to connect to your server
